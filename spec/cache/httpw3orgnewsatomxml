This specification provides an API to generate simple notifications to alert users outside of the web page. It does not specify exactly how a user agent should display these notifications; the best presentation depends on the device where the user agent is run. When this specificiation refers to displaying notifications on the "desktop", it generally refers to some static display area outside the web page, but may take several forms, including a corner of the user's display, an area within the chrome of the user agent, or the "home" screen of a mobile device.

Multimodal access means that people may use diverse "modalities" for interaction with the Web, including screen, keyboard, digital ink, voice, speech output, etc. The Working Group has defined a general and flexible framework providing interoperability among modality-specific components from different vendors - for example, speech recognition from one vendor and handwriting recognition from another. The current Note provides additional informative guidelines for authors of MMI modality components. Its purpose is to help authors create useful  constituents that may be more easily incorporated into a multimodal system.

W3C is developing a <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wiki/Testing">comprehensive test suite</a> to help achieve broad interoperability for the full specification. Stable specifications are useful targets for interoperability at the same time that innovation never ceases. Therefore, to fulfill the W3C HTML Working Group's mission, W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee encourages the participants to begin discussion of requirements for future versions of HTML after HTML5 reaches Last Call.
