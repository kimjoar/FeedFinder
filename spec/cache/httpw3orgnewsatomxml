RDFa Core 1.1 is a specification for attributes to express structured data in any markup language. The embedded data already available in the markup language (e.g., XHTML) is reused by the RDFa markup, so that publishers don't need to repeat significant data in the document content. XHTML+RDFa 1.1 is an XHTML family markup language. That extends the XHTML 1.1 markup language with the attributes defined in RDFa Core 1.1.

The present draft specification of Emotion Markup Language 1.0 aims to strike a balance between practical applicability and basis in science. The language is conceived as a "plug-in" language suitable for use in three different areas: (1) manual annotation of data; (2) automatic recognition of emotion-related states from user behavior; and (3) generation of emotion-related system behavior.

Users trust enormous amounts of personal information to a large variety of online services including social network sites, search engines, photo and video sharing services, and hosted email solutions. As those services become ever more tightly integrated, it becomes increasingly difficult to control the spread of information on the Web. Participants will represent a broad set of stakeholders, including researchers, database manufacturers, CRM-system manufacturers, and Social Networking Providers. Participants will study whether there is interest in further work on policy languages and data handling/data usage work within W3C. Anyone may participate in the Workshop; all participants must submit a short <a href="/2010/policy-ws/#paper">position paper</a>.

User agents commonly apply same-origin restrictions to network requests. These restrictions prevent a client-side Web application running from one origin from obtaining data retrieved from another origin, and also limit unsafe HTTP requests that can be automatically launched toward destinations that differ from the running application's origin. In user agents that follow this pattern, network requests typically use ambient authentication and session management information, including HTTP authentication and cookie information.

        <![CDATA[<p>W3C is pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/">Unicorn</a>, a one-stop tool to help people improve the quality of their Web pages. Unicorn combines a number of popular tools in a single, easy interface, including the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">Markup validator</a>, <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS validator</a>, <a href="http://validator.w3.org/mobile/">mobileOk checker</a>, and <a href="http://validator.w3.org/feed/">Feed validator</a>, which remain available as individual services as well. W3C invites developers to enhance the service by <a href="http://code.w3.org/unicorn/wiki/Documentation/Observer">creating new modules</a> and testing them in our <a href="http://code.w3.org/unicorn/wiki#DevelopUnicornandValidationServices">online developer space</a> (or <a href="http://code.w3.org/unicorn/wiki/Documentation/Install">installing Unicorn locally</a>). W3C looks forward to code contributions from the community as well as <a href="http://code.w3.org/unicorn/wiki#Feedback">suggestions for new features</a>. W3C would like to thank the many people whose work has led up to this first release of Unicorn. This includes developers  who started and improved the tool over the past few years, users who have provided feedback, <a href="http://code.w3.org/unicorn/wiki/Translators">translators</a> who have helped localize the interface with  <a href="http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/translations">21 translations</a> so far, and sponsors HP and Mozilla and other individual donors. W3C welcomes <a href="http://code.w3.org/unicorn/wiki#Feedback">feedback</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/Donate">donations</a> so that W3C can continue to expand this free service to the community.

W3C is organizing a Workshop: 
<a href="/International/multilingualweb/madrid/cfp">The Multilingual Web - Where Are We?</a>, to take place 26-27 October 2010 in Madrid, Spain. Workshop participants will  survey and introduce currently available best practices and standards that help content creators, localizers, language technology developers, browser makers, and others meet the challenges of the multilingual Web. The Workshop also provides opportunities for networking that span the various communities involved in enabling the multilingual Web. <a href="/International/multilingualweb/madrid/cfp#participation">Participation</a> is free and open to anyone. However, space is limited and participants must send an <a href="/International/multilingualweb/madrid/cfp#eoi">expression of interest</a> to the program committee. People wishing to speak should also submit a presentation outline as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
This is the first of four Workshops being planned by W3C over the next two years as part of the <a href="http://www.multilingualweb.eu/">MultilingualWeb</a> European Project. The first Workshop is hosted by the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. For more information, see the <a href="/International/multilingualweb/madrid/cfp">call for participation</a>.
